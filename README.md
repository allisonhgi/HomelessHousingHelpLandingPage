## HomelessHousingHelp
Capstone 2022

# Our Project:
As Seattleâ€™s homeless population grows, countless resources attempt to combat this problem. The emergency housing voucher is one program that was implemented to help homeless people afford rent, but a year after distribution, less than half of them have been awarded in Seattle. Many homeless people face the barrier of low tech literacy, so our website is a design-sensitive solution that fills this gap, empowering the homeless community to get the resources they need. We aim to increase voucher applications so that 100% of Seattle vouchers are utilized to connect people with stable housing that could change their lives.
